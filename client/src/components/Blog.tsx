                        <h4 className="text-2xl text-secondary mb-2">How Donating Blood Can Improve Your Health</h4>
                        <p className="text-black">Did you know that donating blood can have health benefits for the donor? Regular donations can improve cardiovascular health by reducing iron levels in the body, which can decrease the risk of heart disease. Additionally, blood donation has been linked to lower cancer risks and offers a mini health check-up, including blood pressure, hemoglobin levels, and cholesterol checks. These health screenings can help identify potential health issues early on. Find out more about how blood donation can positively affect your well-being while helping others. It's a win-win situation where you can improve your health and save lives simultaneously.</p>

                        <p className="text-black">Curious about the donation process? We've got you covered. From registration and pre-donation screening to the actual donation and post-donation recovery, we'll walk you through each step so you know exactly what to expect. The entire process typically takes about an hour, with the actual blood draw lasting only 10-15 minutes.

                        <p className="text-black">There are several ways to donate blood: whole blood, platelet, plasma, and double red cell donations. Each type plays a vital role in patient care. Whole blood donations are the most common, while platelet and plasma donations are crucial for treating cancer patients and those with clotting disorders. Double red cell donations collect twice the amount of red cells, which are essential for trauma and surgery patients. Learn about the different donation methods, their specific benefits, and how you can contribute in various ways to meet the diverse needs of patients. By understanding the different types of donations, you can choose the one that's right for you and help in the most effective way possible.</p>
